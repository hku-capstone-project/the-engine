# Current Progress

## Completed

- C++ build pipeline established using Clang with VCPKG for seamless third-party package integration
- Window system implementation with WINIT
- ImGui integration for immediate mode UI rendering
- Built-in FPS counter with filtering for enhanced readability
- Comprehensive Vulkan wrapper featuring:
  - Buffer and image management with Vulkan Memory Allocator (VMA)
  - Descriptor set system
  - Compute and graphics pipeline support
  - Image sampling capabilities
- Real-time shader compilation pipeline (GLSL to SPIRV) using the Shaderc library
- Full Vulkan validation layer integration for debugging

## Visual Demonstrations

- Functional 3D object rendering within our custom engine environment [TODO:]
- Project architecture overview (folder structure visualization + GitHub repository link)

## Next Development Phase

- Decouple engine from game code through:
  - DLL-based architecture for modular linking, or
  - C# interoperability layer for high-level game logic
- Performance optimization for high-density object rendering
- Comparative benchmarking against industry-standard engines (particularly Unity)
- Implement asset pipeline for streamlined content creation workflow
